In this guide, we'll walk you through common Dashlane issues and provide step-by-step solutions to fix them. Whether you are using Dashlane on a desktop, mobile device, or browser extension, this guide covers the most common problems and how to resolve them.
Common Dashlane Problems

Before diving into troubleshooting, let’s first identify some of the common problems users may experience with Dashlane:

    Login Issues: Users may find it difficult to sign in to their Dashlane account due to incorrect credentials, issues with the master password, or two-factor authentication errors.

    Sync Problems: Your passwords may not sync properly across devices, leaving you unable to access your vault from other platforms.

    Autofill Not Working: Dashlane may fail to autofill your login credentials in websites and apps, reducing the app’s convenience and functionality.

    Crashes and Freezing: Dashlane might freeze or crash unexpectedly, which can be especially annoying if you need to access your vault urgently.

    Browser Extension Not Working: The Dashlane browser extension may stop working or fail to load, which can interfere with autofill and other Dashlane features.

    Slow Performance: Dashlane might experience performance issues, such as running slowly or taking too long to load passwords or vault data.

    Security Concerns: Some users may encounter security-related issues, such as suspected unauthorized access to their Dashlane vault.

Now, let's explore how to fix these common Dashlane problems.
1. Fixing Login Issues

If you're unable to log into your Dashlane account, it’s crucial to identify the root cause. Below are some common reasons and solutions for login issues:
Incorrect Master Password

Your master password is the key to unlocking your Dashlane vault. If you're having trouble logging in, ensure you're entering the correct master password. Double-check your password for typos, and ensure Caps Lock or Num Lock is turned off.
Master Password Recovery

If you’ve forgotten your master password and cannot log in, Dashlane offers a recovery process. However, this process may not always work depending on your settings (e.g., if you disabled password recovery options). Follow Dashlane's instructions for recovery, but note that if recovery options aren’t set up, your only solution might be to reset your account and start fresh.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Issues

If you have enabled two-factor authentication for your account, make sure you’re entering the correct verification code. Ensure that the device generating the code (such as your smartphone) is working properly and that the time settings on your phone are correct, as this can affect the generation of valid codes.
2. Fixing Syncing Issues Across Devices

Dashlane allows you to sync your vault across all devices you use, but sometimes syncing can fail. Here’s how to address syncing problems:
Check Your Internet Connection

Ensure that your device is connected to a stable internet connection. Syncing can fail if there are issues with the network, such as weak Wi-Fi or network instability. Switch to a more reliable connection if needed.
Sign Out and Sign Back In

Sometimes, logging out and logging back into your Dashlane account can resolve syncing issues. This refreshes your session and may fix problems related to vault syncing across devices.
Force Sync

If you’re using Dashlane on a mobile device, you can manually initiate a sync. In the app, go to the settings or vault section and look for an option to force sync. On desktop versions, syncing typically happens automatically, but you can check the sync status in the settings.
Check for Updates

Ensure that your Dashlane app is up to date on all devices. Dashlane regularly releases updates to fix bugs and improve syncing features. If you’re using an outdated version, syncing problems could occur. Update your app from the relevant app store (for mobile) or through the Dashlane website (for desktop).
Check for Server Issues

Sometimes Dashlane may experience temporary server outages or maintenance, which can affect syncing. Visit Dashlane’s status page or check their social media channels for updates on whether this is the case.
3. Fixing Autofill Problems

Autofill is one of Dashlane's key features, but sometimes it may stop working, particularly in browsers or apps. Here's how to fix autofill issues:
Enable Autofill in Your Browser

Ensure that Dashlane's browser extension is installed and enabled. If you're using Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, make sure that the Dashlane extension is properly integrated. In your browser settings, check that the Dashlane extension is allowed to run.
Clear Browser Cache and Cookies

Sometimes cached data or cookies can cause conflicts with autofill. Clearing your browser's cache and cookies might resolve issues where Dashlane isn't autofilling login credentials.
Enable Autofill in Dashlane Settings

Within the Dashlane app, make sure that autofill is enabled. Go to the settings, and under “Autofill Options,” ensure that Dashlane is selected to fill in passwords, forms, and payment details. If the autofill feature is turned off, turn it back on.
Check for Browser Compatibility

If you’re using a less common browser or an older version, Dashlane may not be fully compatible. Ensure you’re using an updated version of a supported browser like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge.
Disable Conflicting Extensions

Some browser extensions can conflict with Dashlane’s autofill feature. Disable other password managers or extensions that might interfere with Dashlane and check if autofill starts working.
4. Fixing Crashes or Freezing

If Dashlane is crashing or freezing unexpectedly, try the following steps:
Update Dashlane

Outdated versions of Dashlane may contain bugs or compatibility issues. Always check for the latest version of the app and update it if necessary.
Reinstall Dashlane

Uninstalling and reinstalling Dashlane can often resolve issues related to corrupted files or settings. This will ensure you have a fresh installation and can fix any bugs causing crashes.
Clear App Cache (Mobile Devices)

For mobile devices, clearing the app cache can resolve issues where the app behaves abnormally. Go to your device’s settings, find the Dashlane app, and clear its cache.
Check for Conflicting Software

If Dashlane is only freezing on your desktop, there might be conflicts with other software or antivirus programs. Try temporarily disabling antivirus or firewall software to see if it resolves the issue.
5. Fixing Browser Extension Issues

If the Dashlane browser extension is not working properly, try the following:
Reinstall the Browser Extension

Sometimes, the extension may become corrupted. Uninstall and reinstall the Dashlane extension for your browser to ensure it is correctly configured.
Check Browser Settings

Ensure that your browser is allowing extensions to function correctly. Some browsers may block certain types of extensions by default, so make sure Dashlane is enabled in the browser settings.
Disable Conflicting Extensions

As mentioned earlier, other browser extensions may interfere with Dashlane. Disable any other password managers or security extensions and check if Dashlane works properly.
Try a Different Browser

If the Dashlane extension isn’t working on one browser, try using a different supported browser to see if the problem persists. Dashlane supports Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge.
6. Fixing Slow Performance

If Dashlane is running slowly, it could be due to a number of factors. Here’s how to improve performance:
Close Unnecessary Applications

If your computer or mobile device is running multiple applications, it may slow down Dashlane’s performance. Close any unnecessary programs to free up system resources.
Check Device Storage

Make sure your device has enough free storage space. Low disk space can slow down Dashlane, especially if you have a large number of passwords stored.
Check for System Updates

Ensure that your operating system is up to date. Dashlane may not perform optimally on outdated systems.
7. Fixing Security Issues

If you suspect unauthorized access to your Dashlane account or face any security-related issues, follow these steps:
Change Your Master Password

If you think your account has been compromised, immediately change your master password. Use a strong and unique password that includes a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.
Enable Two-Factor Authentication

Activate two-factor authentication (2FA) for an added layer of security. This will require you to enter a verification code, in addition to your master password, when logging in.
Check Account Activity

Review your account activity and connected devices to ensure no unauthorized access has occurred. Dashlane provides a log of recent account activity and device connections in your account settings.
Contact Dashlane Support

If you believe your account has been compromised, contact Dashlane's customer support team immediately for further assistance.

Whether you’re dealing with login problems, syncing issues, or crashes, most problems can be resolved with the solutions outlined in this guide.
